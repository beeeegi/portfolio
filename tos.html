        <!-- Section 1: Agreement to Terms -->
        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> When you initiate a commission for development work from me, you agree to all terms mentioned herein. The parties must make sure they have read through these terms thoroughly before initiating any commission.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> The noncompliance of the above conditions may and will cause the cancellation of the commission without returning the fee or taking any further action which must be taken in order to safeguard the interests of both parties.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3</strong> These conditions may change and they do not have to give a notice before doing so. You bear the burden of ensuring that you periodically check these conditions for any changes.</p>
        <p><strong>1.4</strong> By accepting orders from me, you confirm that you have accepted these terms. If this is not the case, do not ask me to perform any work.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Payment and Pricing -->
        <h2>2. Payment and Pricing</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> Payments can be executed using either PayPal or Robux. Please be informed that, for PayPal payments, additional costs of 10% are charged due to other payment costs. In Robux payments, the tax costs involved must be catered for in order to guarantee receipt of the correct amount.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2</strong> The payment of the commission should be done no later than 12 hours after completion of the commission. In case, you want to make a split payment (some in the beginning and rest at advance), this should be discussed prior to starting the work. Otherwise, delays or even canceling your commission may be inevitable.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3</strong> All fees charged are non-redeemable. They will only issue refunds only when I had asked for it. This is because there is a process that needs to be adhered to when getting a commission as well as limits that PayPal has placed with regards to cashing out. In matters of dispute, I will not have any obligation to go through with the commission and will provide a refund where it is justified.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4</strong> The price list is stated in US dollars concerning Paypal transactions while it is presented in Robux concerning settlement by the game Roblox. You understand that you may incur and will be responsible to pay some other taxes, fees and or charges as regard your mode of payment.</p>
        <p><strong>2.5</strong> If the client fails to pay within the period agreed upon, then either a late fee a charged or the commission can be terminated to my discretion. A Proper payment schedule is strictly observed in order for the smooth flow of the task and time and resources of the parties involved to be preserved.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Scope of Work and Revisions -->
        <h2>3. Scope of Work and Revisions</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> I aim at the quality of work that the outlined requirements will be provided without variance at the time of commissioning. In hiring, it is paramount that the task list is given up front in detail so all the details are grasped from the beginning. There will be no conflicts and you will be content with the work that is done.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2</strong> Client reviews shall settle within the limits of the specification. Generally, further changes to ideal work are allowed but structural shifts or extensive revision may require extra charges. It is important to obtain final agreement on the requirements before the work commences to avoid the likelihood of making major corrections later on.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3</strong> I will address all bugs related to the script and the product that was written for you for the period of two days after delivery of the product. After this time period, other repairs or changes will be agreed upon whereby new fees will be applicable in a new commission.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4</strong> The finished product will be returned to the client in the form agreed upon in the commissioning process. This includes documents, softwares, films, or other materials referred to in the contract made in the beginning.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Communication and Conduct -->
        <h2>4. Communication and Conduct</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> If you want my help, please be more specific about the nature of help that you seek. One of the best ways to augur for a successful partnership is communication to enhance that your expectations are met.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2</strong> I would appreciate it if my clients could at least try to understand any kind of frustration or setbacks if the commissioning process is delayed for a reason. Team members need to value one another so as to promote a healthy working environment. Offensiveness and bullying of any kind is unacceptable and in some instances may lead to the commission being terminated forfeiving any chance of getting a return.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3</strong> Revenue sharing and other means of payments are not acceptable until such a stage as the game launched or is nearing release and has an active fan base. It is a fact that revenue sharing contains a lot of risks and I do not wish to take on the risk of repeating that due to late payments for my service.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4</strong> Provide good references and relevant examples of the work you intend to complete in order to help me capture your concept. What would clear you is that I will be able to deliver and sail through all your expectations despite the fulfillment of your requirements because of the clear references provided.</p>

        <!-- Section 5: Showcase and Confidentiality -->
        <h2>5. Showcase and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> All the products that I will create will be on display and used in a variety of ways and including portfolio, Social Network sites, etc., in order to showcase my achievements. It aids me in course of developing my portfolio and seeking future clients. If this makes you uncomfortable, please let me know before the commission is made.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> Related to the subject of the commission all information and data received will be non-disclosed and will not be shared with any other party without your consent. All the proprietary information provided to me should be secured and protected for your privacy and for the protection of your intellectual property.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3</strong> In case of need, we shall sign an NDA only if the client requests us to do so after confirming a commission and prior to the commissioning process. I am open to signing NDA agreements regarding projects that require confidentiality and proprietary ideas.</p>

        <!-- Section 6: Termination and Cancellation -->
        <h2>6. Termination and Cancellation</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1</strong> In circumstances that can be reasonably agreed do either the client or the contractor have the right to terminate the commission. In such situations any work that has been done before that instant will be handed over and the payments due will be made. The notice of request for termination of the commission should be given in time to eliminate the likelihood of claims and disputes.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> A warning that a commission has been cancelled must be given as soon as possible. The refund to be made, if any, shall take into account the partial delivery of work done and costs incurred. All refunds are also at my discretion and usually only granted under circumstances that led to the cancellation.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3</strong> If I need to cancel the commission, for any reason I will refund you fully or partially back based on how far along I am and what is actually happening. My target is to make all these transactions more fair and transparent.</p>
