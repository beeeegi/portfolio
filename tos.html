            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        </header>

        <main class="tos-content">
            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p><strong>1.1</strong> By starting a commission with me, you agree to these terms. Please read everything before we begin to make sure we're on the same page.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2</strong> If these terms are not followed, I might need to cancel the project, and no refunds will be issued.</p>
            <p><strong>1.3</strong> These terms might change occasionally. I will inform you if there are any significant changes.</p>
            <p><strong>1.4</strong> By moving forward with a project, you confirm that you’ve accepted these terms. If you have any concerns, let’s discuss them before starting the work.</p>

            <h2>2. Payment and Pricing</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1</strong> Payments can be made via PayPal or Robux. PayPal payments come with a 10% processing fee, and Robux payments should account for platform fees to ensure I   receive the full amount.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2</strong> A 50% deposit is required upfront before starting any work. The remaining 50% must be paid within 12 hours of project completion. If the remaining balance  isn't paid within 12 hours, an additional 10% fee will be added to the total. If 24 hours pass without payment, I will report the matter to relevant third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3</strong> Refunds aren’t offered unless there’s a clear issue from my side. I will do my best to resolve any problems fairly if they arise.</p>
            <p><strong>2.4</strong> Prices are listed in USD (for PayPal) or Robux (for Roblox). Any additional taxes or fees are your responsibility, depending on the payment method you  choose.</p>
            <p><strong>2.5</strong> PayPal payments must be sent using the 'Friends and Family' option. If payment is sent incorrectly, you have 24 hours to request a refund. After this time,     payments are final.</p>

            <h2>3. Scope of Work and Revisions</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1</strong> I’ll ensure that the work meets the agreed-upon requirements. Please provide detailed instructions before the project starts to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2</strong> Minor changes are included, but if major revisions are needed, we can discuss additional charges. It’s best to finalize details upfront to avoid extra  costs later.</p>
            <p><strong>3.3</strong> I’ll fix any bugs for free within 48 hours of delivery. After that, any fixes will come with additional charges.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4</strong> The final product will be delivered in the agreed format. If there’s any issue with the delivery format, we can discuss alternatives to make sure it works  for you.</p>

            <h2>4. Communication and Conduct</h2>
            <p><strong>4.1</strong> Clear communication is key. Please be specific about what you need so I can deliver exactly what you're expecting.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2</strong> If there are any delays or setbacks, I’ll keep you updated. Respect and understanding go both ways—offensive behavior won’t be tolerated and may lead to    cancellation without a refund if it gets in the way of the project.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3</strong> I don’t accept revenue-sharing deals unless the game has more than 200 concurrent players and the percentage offered is 5% or higher.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4</strong> Providing clear examples or references will help me meet your expectations. Good guidance leads to better results.</p>

            <h2>5. Showcase and Confidentiality</h2>
            <p><strong>5.1</strong> I have full permission to showcase the work I’ve done for you in my portfolio, on my website, and on social media. I will not share source code or  sensitive information, but I may showcase the project’s price, your username, and your current profile picture.</p>
            <p><strong>5.2</strong> Any private information shared with me will stay confidential unless you give me permission to share it. Your data and ideas are safe with me.</p>
            <p><strong>5.3</strong> I do not sign NDAs or other agreements of that nature.</p>

            <h2>6. Termination and Cancellation</h2>
            <p><strong>6.1</strong> You cannot cancel the project with a refund. If you cancel, you will still owe the 50% upfront payment, and an additional 10% of the original project cost will be charged.</p>
            <p><strong>6.2</strong> If I cancel the project, I will offer a full refund. You are not allowed to report, use any third-party methods or take further action against me after claiming a refund.</p>
