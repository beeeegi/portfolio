        <!-- Section 1: Agreement to Terms -->
        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> By commissioning me for development work, you agree to all terms and conditions outlined in this document. It is important to read and understand these terms fully before proceeding with any commission.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> Failure to comply with these terms may result in the cancellation of the commission without a refund or any further action as deemed necessary to protect both parties' interests.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3</strong> These terms are subject to change at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review these terms periodically to stay informed of any updates.</p>
        <p><strong>1.4</strong> By continuing to use my services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms outlined in this document. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from commissioning me.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Payment and Pricing -->
        <h2>2. Payment and Pricing</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> Payments can be made via PayPal or Robux. Please note that a 10% surcharge is applied for payments made through PayPal to cover additional transaction fees. When paying in Robux, you must cover the associated tax to ensure the correct amount is received.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2</strong> Payment must be made within 12 hours after the commission is completed. If you prefer to split the payment (partially upfront and the remainder upon completion), this must be agreed upon before the work begins. Failure to adhere to these terms may result in delays or cancellation of your commission.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3</strong> All payments are final. No refunds will be issued unless I specifically request it. This policy is due to the time and effort involved in completing a commission and the restrictions on PayPal payouts. In case of disputes, I reserve the right to cancel the commission and provide a refund if deemed necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4</strong> Prices are quoted in USD for PayPal transactions and in Robux for Roblox payments. You are responsible for covering any additional taxes, fees, or currency conversion costs that may apply to your payment method.</p>
        <p><strong>2.5</strong> If payment is not made within the agreed timeframe, a late fee may be charged, or the commission may be canceled at my discretion. Timely payment is essential to maintaining a smooth workflow and respecting both parties' time and effort.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Scope of Work and Revisions -->
        <h2>3. Scope of Work and Revisions</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> I strive to deliver high-quality work that meets the specifications provided at the time of commissioning. It is essential to provide a clear and detailed task list before hiring to ensure that all requirements are understood from the outset. This helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures that the work aligns with your expectations.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2</strong> Revisions are only provided if there are no other pending commissions in the queue. Minor adjustments to the completed work are acceptable, but major revisions or changes in scope may incur additional charges. It is crucial to finalize your requirements before the commission starts to minimize the need for significant changes later on.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3</strong> I will fix any bugs found in the script I created for up to two days after the product is delivered to you. After this period, any additional fixes or adjustments may be subject to new charges or a new commission agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4</strong> Completed work will be delivered in the format agreed upon during the commissioning process. This can include files, scripts, or other digital assets as specified in the initial agreement.</p>

        <!-- Section 4: Communication and Conduct -->
        <h2>4. Communication and Conduct</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> When reaching out to me, please be direct and clear about the assistance you need. Effective communication is key to a successful collaboration and ensures that your expectations are met.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2</strong> I expect clients to be patient and understanding if the commission is delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. Treating each other with respect is vital to maintaining a positive working relationship. Disrespectful behavior or harassment will not be tolerated and may result in the cancellation of the commission without a refund.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3</strong> I do not accept revenue sharing as a form of payment unless the game is already released or has a substantial community awaiting its release. Revenue sharing carries significant risks, and I prefer upfront payment to ensure fair compensation for my work.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4</strong> It is advisable to provide good references and examples that help me understand your vision and expectations. Clear references make it easier for me to work efficiently and produce results that align with your needs.</p>

        <!-- Section 5: Showcase and Confidentiality -->
        <h2>5. Showcase and Confidentiality</h2>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> I reserve the right to showcase any product I make in my portfolio, on social media, or in other venues to demonstrate my work. This helps me build my portfolio and attract future clients. If you have concerns about this, please discuss them with me before the commission begins.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> All information and data related to the commission will be kept confidential and will not be shared with third parties without your consent. Any sensitive information provided to me must be handled securely and responsibly to protect your privacy and intellectual property.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3</strong> If you require a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be signed before starting the commission, please provide it in advance. I am willing to sign NDAs for projects that involve sensitive information or proprietary concepts.</p>

        <!-- Section 6: Termination and Cancellation -->
        <h2>6. Termination and Cancellation</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1</strong> Either party may terminate the commission under mutually agreed conditions. In such cases, any work completed up to the point of termination will be delivered, and payments will be settled accordingly. It is important to communicate promptly if you wish to terminate the commission to avoid misunderstandings or conflicts.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> Cancellation of a commission must be communicated as soon as possible. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed based on the amount of work completed and any expenses incurred. The final decision on refunds will be at my discretion, depending on the circumstances surrounding the cancellation.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3</strong> If I need to cancel the commission for any reason, I will provide a full or partial refund depending on the progress of the work and the specific situation. My goal is to ensure fairness and transparency in all transactions.</p>
